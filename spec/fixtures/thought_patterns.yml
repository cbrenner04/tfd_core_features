all_or_nothing:
  title: All-or-Nothing (Black-or-White) Thinking
  description: You see things in black-and-white categories. If your performance
    falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure.
  recommendations: Try to engage in more balanced thinking. Are there shades of gray? Are there exceptions to your all or nothing thinking? Look for them. What if you looked at the issue along a continuum rather than in simple categories? Remember that things are usually somewhere between 0 and 100 percent and not one way or the other.

overgeneralization:
  title: Overgeneralization
  description: You see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.
  recommendations: Are you condemning yourself based on a single event? What if you focused on describing rather than judging? Am I assuming that every situation and every person are the same? This is just one situation; one person. Can I remember other situations and people that are different?

mental_filter:
  title: Mental Filter
  description: You pick out a single negative defeat and dwell on it exclusively
    so that your vision of reality becomes darkened, like the drop of ink that
    colors the entire beaker of water.
  recommendations: Try to catch the positive. What are some positive things that discount your thought? How would you feel if you acknowledged the positive information? How might other people see this issue? Would they pick up on positive things that had happened? What would be the consequence if everyone didn't notice positive events and only saw things as negative?

jumping:
  title: Fortune Telling
  description: You make a negative interpretation even though there are no
    definite facts that convincingly support your conclusion.
  recommendations: Can we really know what others are thinking? What are possible alternatives to why they might be behaving the way they are behaving? Can we really predict the future? What would it be like to find out how it really is rather than just imagine it?

magnification:
  title: Magnification or Catastrophizing
  description: "You exaggerate the importance of things (such as your goof-up or
    someone else's achievement)"
  recommendations: How big is this problem really? Where is it likely to really lead? How might you deal with this problem? Write an action plan. Are you telling yourself that you cannot possibly cope with this issue? If so; is it possible for you to identify or learn coping skills to deal with the challenge? Even if one possible outcome is catastrophic; is such a bad end likely to actually be the result? If it didn't end up being quite as bad; would it be as distressing?

should:
  title: \"Should\" Statements
  description: "You try to motivate yourself with shoulds and shouldn'ts, as if
    you had to be whipped and punished before you could be expected to do
    anything. \"Musts\" and \"oughts\" are also offenders. The emotional
    consequence is guilt.

    When you direct should statements toward others, you feel anger,
    frustration, and resentment."
  recommendations: Shoulda coulda woulda

labeling:
  title: Labeling and Mislabeling
  description: "This is an extreme form of overgeneralization. Instead of
    describing your error, you attach a negative label to yourself: \"I'm a
    loser.\" When someone else's behavior rubs you the wrong way, you attach a
    negative label to him: \"He's a goddam louse\".

    Mislabeling involves describing an event with language that is highly
    colored and emotionally loaded."
  recommendations: Is it so simple?

personalization:
  title: Personalization
  description: You see yourself as the cause of some negative external event
    which in fact you were not primarily responsible for.
  recommendations: Is that yours to take on?
